# ðŸªœ Ladder Legends - Web Application

## Description

A web application for gaming organizations and players to keep real-time updates on the changing ranks, which was taken from the Riot API. The inception of the idea conincides with Mia's experience in e-sports teams, as a player and organization lead. Our desire to create a friendly culture of competition between members of e-sports teams across organizations by using the affiliation to the group and its members become a motivator to continue progressing in their ranking. As a team, each member was pushed to explore in unknown aspects of programming. Saif (the backend developer) explored the use of Python and MongoDB; Mia and Samuel (the front end developers and UI/UX designers) explored React.js rather than traditional CSS and HTML web applications; and Jorden (the UI/UX designer and 3D artist) explored Blender. Pushing ourselves outside of our comfort levels was the significant contribution this project had on us, as individuals and teammates.
