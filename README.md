# Ladder Legends - Web Application

## Description

A web application for gaming organizations and players to keep real-time updates on the changing ranks, which was taken from the Riot API. The inception of the idea conincides with Mia's experience in e-sports teams, as a player and organization lead. Our desire to create a friendly culture of competition between members of e-sports teams across organizations by using the affiliation to the group and its members become a motivator to continue progressing in their ranking. As a team, each member was pushed to explore in unknown aspects of programming. Saif (the background developer) explored the use of Python and MongoDB; Mia and Samuel (the front end developers and UI/UX designers) explored React.js rather than traditional CSS and HTML web applications; and Jorden (the UI/UX designer and 3D artist) explored Blender. Pushing ourselves outside of our comfort levels was the significant contribution this project had on us, as individuals and teammates.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
