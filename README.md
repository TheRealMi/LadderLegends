# 🪜 Ladder Legends - Web Application

## 📝 Description

Ladder Legends is a web application designed for gaming organizations and players who want to stay updated in real-time on their changing ranks, sourced directly from the Riot API. This project was born out of Mia's firsthand experience in e-sports teams, both as a player and an organization leader. Our vision is to foster a friendly culture of competition among members of e-sports teams, encouraging progress in their rankings through affiliation with their group and its members.

Saif (the backend developer) explored the use of Python and MongoDB; Mia and Angelo (the front end developers and UI/UX designers) explored React.js rather than traditional CSS and HTML web applications; and Jorden (the UI/UX designer and 3D artist) explored Blender. Pushing ourselves outside of our comfort levels was the significant contribution this project had on us, as individuals and teammates.
