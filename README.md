# 🪜 Ladder Legends - Web Application

## 📝 Description

Ladder Legends is a web application designed for gaming organizations and players who want to stay updated in real-time on their changing ranks, sourced directly from the Riot API. This project was born out of Mia's firsthand experience in e-sports teams, both as a player and an organization leader. Our vision is to foster a friendly culture of competition among members of e-sports teams, encouraging progress in their rankings through affiliation with their group and its members. Pushing ourselves outside of our comfort levels was the significant contribution this project had on us, as individuals and teammates.
